Description: Rare Variant Sharing (RVS) implements tests of association
    and linkage between rare genetic variant genotypes and a dichotomous
    phenotype, e.g. a disease status, in family samples. The tests are
    based on probabilities of rare variant sharing by relatives under
    the null hypothesis of absence of linkage and association between
    the rare variants and the phenotype and apply to single variants or
    multiple variants in a region (e.g. gene-based test).
